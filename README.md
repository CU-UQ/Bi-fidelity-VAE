# Bi-fidelity Variational Auto-encoder
## Description of code 
### Main file 

- **models.py**: contain a bi-fidelity data class BFDataset, a fully-connected variational auto-encoder class, and a fully-connected bi-fidelity variational auto-encoder; 

### Helper file

- **MMD_func.py**: compute the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) with a mixture of rational quadratic kernels;

### Experiment files

- **BF-VAE-beam.ipynb**: BF-VAE implementation on the composite beam model with MMD results;

- **BF-VAE-cav.ipynb**: BF-VAE implementation on the cavity flow model with MMD results;

- **BF-VAE-burgers.ipynb**: BF-VAE implementation on the 1D visous Burgers model with MMD results.

## Data

The bi-fidelity data is available in this link.
